Program development plan:

Task analysis: Consider the requirements for the program and understand what functions it should perform.

Creating the "Book" class: Create a class that represents a book with properties: Title, Author, ISBN number, Year of publication.

Creating the "Library" class: Create a class that will manage books in the library. Add methods for adding, deleting, searching, and displaying books.

Implementation of the main program: Create the main program class where the library object will be created and user actions will be processed.

Testing: Cover the functionality of the program with tests.

The sequence of actions performed:

Create a "Book" class with properties: Title, Author, ISBN number, Year of publication.

Create a "Library" class with methods:

Adding a new book to the library.
Removing a book from the library by its ISBN number.
Search for a book by title.
Displaying all books in the library.
Create the main class of the program, where to initialize the library object.

Write tests to check the functionality of the program.

Run the program and check if it performs all the necessary tasks.
