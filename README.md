The task is to create a Java application for a cinema with five halls, each having seating arrangements of 10 rows and 20 seats. The seating is represented by a 3D array, where the first dimension represents the hall, the second represents the row, and the third represents the seat. The goal is to implement various functionalities using multidimensional arrays, array manipulations, and complex algorithms to address real-world scenarios, promoting a deeper understanding of arrays in Java.
