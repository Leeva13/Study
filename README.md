We created a basic e-commerce system with Product, Cart, and Order entities. 
Each of these entities has the necessary attributes and functionality to add products to the cart, remove products from the cart, place an order, and get the order status.
We wrote JUnit test cases to verify the functionality of your system. Tested adding and removing products from the cart, placing an order, and getting the order status.
You recorded the behavior of methods using the Mockito library, which allowed you to create fake objects and change their behavior during testing.
You have successfully completed the assignment by developing a basic e-commerce system and writing appropriate tests to verify its functionality. 
The use of JUnit and Mockito allowed you to effectively test your code and make sure it works. Now you understand how these tools work and know how to use them in practice to develop and test programs.
